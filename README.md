SPECIAL CONSIDERATION:

YanDi Choong had an unexpected circumstance which affected the project group of 3 people. 
Every member of the group made their best contribution, taking into account their individual circumstances. 
There were limited resources to fully debug codes, fully analyse price & demand correlation, and comprehensive report writing. 
Please take this into account during marking. Thank you.
